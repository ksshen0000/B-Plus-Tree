# B+ Tree
C++ Implementation of the B+ Tree data structure. Implemented it for the lab task of the Data Mining and Machine Learning course. 

The insert function of B+ Tree is fully implemented here. But the Delete functionality is incomplete so please don't use it.

I also wrote codes to do a bfs/dfs traversal and check out the current state of the tree. 

In BFS, the values in each node are separated level and node wise. 

In DFS, the program will wait for you to press a key (Please press enter here). Then it will move to the next child or will be returned to the parent. In each node, the information about the values, pointers and child nodes will be printed.
